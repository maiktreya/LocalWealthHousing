# Features and requirements to conduct a pilot-study (10%-20% size of a fully fledged survey)

A **pilot study** is a small-scale preliminary study conducted to evaluate feasibility, time, cost, risk, and data collection methods before launching a full-scale research project. Its primary purpose is to identify potential issues and refine the study design to ensure the main research will be more effective and efficient. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the requisites and characteristics of a pilot study:

### 1. **Objectives of a Pilot Study**

The key goals of a pilot study include:
- **Feasibility**: Determine whether the research methodology is viable within the given resources (time, budget, and manpower).
- **Testing Instruments**: Assess whether the tools (questionnaires, surveys, etc.) and methods work as intended, and refine them as needed.
- **Logistics and Workflow**: Test the practical logistics of the study (e.g., recruitment, data collection, and management).
- **Data Quality**: Identify potential issues with data collection, such as missing data or misunderstanding of questions.
- **Statistical Power**: Provide an estimate of the variability in your outcome measures to ensure that your full-scale study will have enough statistical power.
- **Recruitment and Retention**: Evaluate how easy it is to recruit participants and whether they stay in the study.
- **Costs and Time**: Gauge how much time and money the full study might require.

### 2. **Requisites for Conducting a Pilot Study**

#### a) **Clear Research Questions**
   - **Feasibility Focused**: The research questions for a pilot study should focus on whether the procedures and instruments can be effectively used for the larger study. For example, "Is the survey easy for participants to complete?" or "Can we effectively reach our target population?"
   
   - **Refinement**: The pilot should not focus on answering the primary research question, but on refining the research tools and methods.

#### b) **Representative but Scaled-Down Sample**
   - The sample size is typically much smaller than the full study (about **10-15%** of the intended final sample). It should still be representative of the population you will target in the full study, but it doesn't have to meet the same rigorous statistical requirements.
   
   - For example, if you're targeting 200 students per university for your main survey, you might survey 20-30 students in each stratum for the pilot study.

#### c) **Pilot Study Design Should Mimic Full Study Design**
   - The design of the pilot study should mirror the full study in terms of methods, sampling techniques, and measurement tools. This ensures that the results and lessons learned are applicable to the full study.
   
   - For instance, if your main study involves stratified sampling with surveys distributed electronically, the pilot should follow the same process.

#### d) **Preliminary Hypotheses**
   - Although the pilot is not meant to answer the main research questions, it can be helpful to have preliminary hypotheses that guide your understanding of how the instruments and methodologies will perform.

#### e) **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Develop clear criteria for assessing the success of the pilot. For example, you might measure the **completion rate** of the survey, the **clarity of survey questions**, and whether participants understood the instructions.

#### f) **Ethical Considerations**
   - Even though it’s a preliminary study, ethical guidelines still apply. You need to obtain informed consent from participants and ensure that they understand the study’s purpose and their rights, just as you would in the main study.

### 3. **Characteristics of a Pilot Study**

#### a) **Smaller Sample Size**
   - A pilot study typically has a **small sample size** because its goal is to test the feasibility of the research design rather than to provide statistically significant results. While it won’t have the power to detect small effects, it can reveal larger issues with your methodology or instrument.

#### b) **Exploratory and Iterative**
   - The pilot study is an opportunity to explore potential problems and iterate on the research design. Expect to make changes based on the findings from your pilot.
   
   - For example, if participants consistently skip a question or answer it incorrectly, you might need to reword it or present it differently in the full study.

#### c) **Focus on Practicalities**
   - Logistics are often a major focus. For instance, you might test how long it takes participants to complete the survey, how well you can recruit participants, and whether the data collection process runs smoothly.

#### d) **Emphasis on Qualitative Feedback**
   - Qualitative feedback is crucial. You should debrief participants after the pilot to gather their thoughts on the process—whether they understood the questions, if they encountered technical problems, and how they felt about the overall study experience.

#### e) **Flexibility in Methods**
   - A pilot study offers the flexibility to try different methods or processes. For example, you could test different recruitment strategies (email, social media, posters) to see which yields the best response rate before the main study.

#### f) **Data Analysis**
   - Although data analysis is not the main focus of a pilot study, analyzing the collected data will help you assess whether your tools are capturing the right information and whether your research hypotheses are feasible.
   
   - You might find that certain questions don’t yield useful information, or that the data isn’t as varied as expected, which could necessitate changes in the survey instrument.

### 4. **Common Adjustments After a Pilot Study**
Based on the pilot study findings, you might decide to:
- **Revise questions**: If some questions were unclear or difficult to answer.
- **Adjust sample recruitment methods**: If recruiting participants was more difficult than anticipated, you might explore other recruitment channels.
- **Revise the data collection process**: If the logistics of collecting data (e.g., online forms, response rates) were problematic.
- **Recalculate the sample size**: Use the data from the pilot to estimate the variability of the main outcome measures, allowing you to recalculate the necessary sample size for the full study.
- **Refine time and cost estimates**: Adjust your budget and timeline based on the pilot study's time and resource consumption.

### 5. **Advantages of Conducting a Pilot Study**

#### a) **Identify Feasibility Issues Early**
   - A pilot study helps uncover practical challenges, allowing you to address them before investing in the larger study. This reduces the risk of failure in the main research.

#### b) **Refine Research Instruments**
   - By testing your questionnaires, surveys, or other instruments, you can fine-tune them to ensure they effectively measure the variables of interest.

#### c) **Estimate Response Rates**
   - You’ll get a realistic sense of how many people are likely to respond to your survey, which will help you adjust your recruitment strategy.

#### d) **Reduce Costs and Time in the Long Run**
   - By identifying and correcting issues during the pilot, you save time and money that might otherwise be wasted on a flawed full-scale study.

### Conclusion:
A pilot study is an essential step for ensuring the success of a larger research project. It allows you to test the feasibility of your methodology, refine your instruments, and improve your research design. Even though the sample size is small and it doesn’t aim to produce final results, the insights gained from a pilot study can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of the full study.
