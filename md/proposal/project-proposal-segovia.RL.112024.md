Certainly. Here’s a refined version incorporating the suggested improvements:

**1. MOTIVATION**

Access to housing has emerged as a central economic issue in Spain, especially regarding rental prices. This challenge stems from a geographically uneven trend that heavily impacts major cities and key tourist areas, while other regions exhibit relative resilience. However, despite its importance, housing issues related to geographic variations, wealth distribution, and rentierism are insufficiently studied in Spain, particularly at a local level within Spain’s two largest metropolitan centers, Madrid and Barcelona. This gap in research limits the understanding of critical housing dynamics and hinders informed policymaking in these areas. Specific obstacles include:

1. The absence of data on housing wealth distribution and rentierism at a granular level, which are necessary to understand the regional disparities and wealth concentration within housing markets;
2. Fragmented and inaccessible information on rental and purchase markets, with much of it privately held by online platforms, limiting its accessibility for public research; and
3. The difficulty of analyzing a diffuse network constituting the demand for rentals and property purchases, which involves diverse population segments with varying influences on market trends.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates AEAT data analysis, systematic data extraction from web platforms, and the design and implementation of a survey targeting key population clusters in the housing demand.

This comprehensive methodology aims to yield a robust understanding of housing dynamics at the city level, including aspects such as ownership, rentierism, tenant composition, and associated challenges. This understanding will be critical for developing policy solutions that can address these complex housing issues at both local and national levels.

We intend to implement a local case study as a proof of concept for this innovative approach. The proposal’s structure is outlined below:

---

**2. SCOPE**

This research focuses on a small provincial capital, Segovia, chosen as a representative case for its unique housing market pressures and significant demographic influences.

---

**3. AIM AND PURPOSE**

Segovia is an ideal case study for several reasons:

1. **Rental Market Pressures**: It ranks among the top Spanish cities facing rental market pressures, with the highest rental price increases recorded in 2023. This provides a critical environment for understanding housing demand and affordability.
   
2. **Tourism and Migration Influence**: Segovia reflects significant factors contributing to distortions in Spain’s housing market, particularly the rapid growth of "touristic housing" driven by platforms such as Airbnb. This development illustrates the dual role of migrants:
   - On one hand, a significant portion of rental households consists of migrant populations, who are often disproportionately affected by rising rental costs.
   - On the other hand, an elite cohort of international students associated with the IE University campus constitutes a substantial segment of the rental market. This pattern, which mirrors dynamics seen in Madrid, where international elites influence rental prices, provides a unique opportunity to explore how different migrant groups impact the housing market in distinct ways.

3. **Lack of Local-Level Analysis**: Smaller cities like Segovia, along with other cities below the level of the Autonomous Communities (CCAA), have received limited research attention in terms of tenancy, wealth distribution, and housing dynamics, leaving critical aspects of the housing market unexamined.

**4. RESEARCH STRUCTURE**

Our study begins with a historical overview of Segovia’s key sociodemographic characteristics, followed by an in-depth analysis of housing wealth distribution and market dynamics. 

At the **quantitative level**, we focus on two key dimensions. First, we analyze tenancy status and housing rentierism, examining their implications for income and wealth distribution. Second, we assess the buying, selling, and rental markets, including trends in pricing, property availability, and other relevant indicators. 

At the **qualitative level**, we will explore tenant characteristics and the internal diversity within the tenant population through:
1. A survey targeting university students from two contrasting groups: public UVA students, who are likely impacted by rising rental costs, and elite IE University students, who are intuitively seen as key drivers behind these increases.
2. Interviews with key stakeholders involved in regulating and addressing the issues stemming from stagnant incomes amid booming rental prices.

Together, these quantitative and qualitative insights will provide a holistic view of Segovia’s housing market dynamics and inform recommendations for local policy interventions.

**5. GOALS & OUTCOMES**

This study aims to enhance the understanding of housing market dynamics at both the local and national levels, with implications for research and policy:

- **Local Impact**: The study will deepen insights into Segovia’s housing market pressures, contributing to evidence-based policy recommendations for local government action.
- **National Relevance**: It will offer a transferable methodology for analyzing housing at a local level across Spain, filling a critical gap in housing market research.
- **Methodological Contribution**: This approach will serve as an adaptable toolkit for further research, supporting the analysis of similar dynamics in other Spanish cities.

**6. REPRODUCIBILITY**

A key outcome of this research is its reproducibility, which, while secondary, remains a critical benefit. By developing a methodological framework adaptable to other micro-level units (e.g., cities, provinces), the project enables future analyses of housing access, ownership patterns, and rentierism in other regions.

This goal will be achieved through two complementary tools:
1. **Methodological Annex**: A comprehensive annex will provide detailed technical and statistical insights that complement the main body of the research.
2. **Public Repositories on GitHub**: Open-access repositories will facilitate replication and adaptation across various regions and research contexts.

One repository will contain the R code necessary to derive a representative sample from the original AEAT Panel de Datos, detailing the construction of essential housing indicators and ratios based on individual income tax records (IRPF) in Spain. The second repository will facilitate the automation of daily data collection and tabulation for rental and sale markets, leveraging customized web scrapers for platforms like Idealista and Airbnb, which serve as primary sources for long-term residents and short-term tourists, respectively.

All code will be released under a widely recognized open-source license (GPL), enabling replication, parallelization, and further development, fostering collaboration and feedback within the research community.

These revisions emphasize the significance of addressing the research gap, provide more details on the methodology, and highlight the policy relevance of the study. This should strengthen the overall robustness and clarity of the proposal. Let me know if further modifications are needed.
