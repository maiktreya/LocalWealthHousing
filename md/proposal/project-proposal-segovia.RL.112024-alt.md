**Title**: **Analyzing Housing Access and Rentierism in Segovia: A Novel Methodological Approach**

---

### **1. Motivation**

Housing access, particularly concerning rental prices, has become arguably the key economic issue in Spanish society today, significantly affecting a substantial portion of the population. This phenomenon is strongly uneven geographically, impacting major cities and key tourism-intensive areas, while other regions remain relatively resilient to such trends. Despite its importance, the geographical dimension of housing issues has been sparsely analyzed beyond the global poles of Madrid and Barcelona. This lack of localized studies impedes a comprehensive understanding of the housing crisis and its socio-economic implications at the micro-level.

**Theoretical Framework**:

This research draws on theories of urban economics and rentierism, examining how housing markets are influenced by factors such as tourism, migration, and socio-economic stratification (Harvey, 1973; Piketty, 2014). The study also considers the concept of "touristification" and its impact on local housing markets (Gotham, 2005; Wachsmuth & Weisler, 2018).

**Research Questions**:

1. **How does the distribution of housing wealth and rentierism manifest at the local level in Segovia?**
2. **What are the characteristics and dynamics of the rental and purchase housing markets in Segovia?**
3. **How do different demographic groups, particularly migrants and university students, influence and experience housing market tensions in Segovia?**
4. **What are the implications of "touristic housing" and platforms like Airbnb on housing affordability and availability in Segovia?**

To address these questions, we propose a novel methodology that combines:

- **Original Exploitation of AEAT Data**: Utilizing data from the Spanish Tax Agency to analyze housing wealth distribution.
- **Standardized Data Extraction from Web Platforms**: Collecting and standardizing information from online housing platforms.
- **Design and Collection of Targeted Surveys**: Developing surveys for key population clusters within the housing demand sector.

This integrated approach will provide a robust understanding of housing characteristics at the city level, including ownership patterns, rentierism, tenant configurations, and internal dynamics.

### **2. Scope**

For this research, we focus on the provincial capital city of **Segovia**.

---

### **3. Aim and Purpose**

Segovia serves as an ideal case study for multiple reasons:

1. **Rental Market Tensions**: It ranks among the top Spanish cities experiencing tensions in its rental market, with the highest increases in rental prices during 2023 (Idealista, 2023).
2. **Impact of Touristic Housing**: The city is experiencing significant distortions in its housing market due to the uncontrolled growth of "touristic housing" facilitated by platforms like Airbnb. This situation underscores the complex role of migrants who occupy two contradictory positions:
   - **Prevalence in Rental Households**: A high prevalence of migrant populations among rental households (INE, 2022).
   - **Influence of Privileged Migrants**: The presence of a "privileged" migrant cohort associated with the development of the IE University campus. Although small in absolute terms, this group constitutes a significant fraction of the rental marketâ€”a scenario similar to that of Madrid becoming a top destination for international students and professionals (Collins, 2010).
3. **Lack of Localized Data**: Cities and geographical areas below the autonomous community level have remained black boxes concerning tenancy, wealth, and housing distribution due to the scarcity of detailed local data.

### **4. Research Structure**

Our study will begin with a historical characterization of Segovia's main sociodemographic traits, followed by an in-depth analysis of its housing wealth distribution and market characteristics.

**Objectives**:

- **Objective 1**: Analyze the distribution of housing wealth and rentierism in Segovia using AEAT data.
- **Objective 2**: Characterize the rental and purchase housing markets in Segovia through data extracted from online platforms.
- **Objective 3**: Understand the socio-demographic profiles of tenants, particularly focusing on the impact of university students and migrant populations.
- **Objective 4**: Examine the influence of "touristic housing" on housing affordability and availability.
- **Objective 5**: Develop a replicable methodology for analyzing housing markets at the local level.

**Methodology**:

- **Quantitative Analysis**:
  1. **Tenancy Status and Rentierism**: Examining tenancy status, housing rentierism, and their implications for income and wealth distribution using AEAT data.
  2. **Market Characterization**: Analyzing the buying/selling and rental markets by tracking the evolution of prices, the number of properties available, and other relevant metrics using data from platforms like Idealista and Airbnb.

- **Qualitative Analysis**:
  - **Tenant Profiling**: Characterizing the main features of tenants and their diverse internal composition through a dual approach:
    1. **Surveys**: Conducting surveys among university students from two contrasting institutions:
       - **Public University of Valladolid (UVA)**: Students assumed to be adversely affected by rising rental prices.
       - **Private IE University (Instituto de Empresa)**: Students intuitively identified as key contributors to escalating rental prices.
    2. **Interviews**: Engaging with key stakeholders (e.g., local government officials, housing associations, real estate agents) involved in regulating and mitigating issues arising from stagnant incomes amid soaring rental prices.

**Ethical Considerations**:

All research involving human participants will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and data protection in compliance with GDPR regulations. Participants will be fully informed about the study's purpose, and their anonymity will be preserved.

### **6. Potential Limitations**

We acknowledge several potential limitations in our study:

- **Data Accessibility**: Obtaining detailed AEAT data may be challenging due to privacy and confidentiality concerns.
- **Response Rates**: Achieving a high response rate for surveys and interviews may be difficult, potentially affecting the representativeness of the qualitative data.
- **Generalizability**: Findings from Segovia may not be fully generalizable to other cities with different socio-economic contexts.
- **Ethical and Legal Constraints**: Scraping data from online platforms must comply with legal terms of service and ethical standards.

To mitigate these limitations, we will:

- Seek necessary permissions and ensure compliance with data protection laws.
- Employ strategies to enhance survey participation, such as incentives and multiple follow-ups.
- Clearly delimit the scope of our findings and recommend caution when applying them to different contexts.
- Use publicly available data and ensure that web data collection complies with platform policies and legal requirements.
