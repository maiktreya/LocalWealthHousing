An API scraper is a tool or script written in Python (or another programming language) that extracts data from a web service's API (Application Programming Interface). Unlike traditional web scraping, which involves fetching and parsing HTML from web pages, API scraping interacts directly with a web service through its defined API endpoints.

Key Concepts of API Scraping:
API Endpoints:

Endpoints are specific URLs provided by the web service where you can request data. Each endpoint typically corresponds to a specific type of data or functionality.
HTTP Methods:

Common HTTP methods used in API scraping include GET (to retrieve data), POST (to send data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove data).
Authentication:

Many APIs require authentication via API keys, OAuth tokens, or other methods to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.
Request Headers:

Additional information sent with API requests to provide context, such as authentication credentials, content type, and user-agent.
Response Formats:

API responses are typically in structured formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language), making them easier to parse and use compared to raw HTML.
Example of API Scraping in Python:
Here is a simple example using Python's requests library to scrape data from an API.
