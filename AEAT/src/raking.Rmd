## Introduction

This document outlines the steps to implement raking in R using the **age** and **gender** distributions for the population of Segovia. Raking adjusts the sample weights to match known population margins, allowing for more representative estimates in the analysis.

## Step 1: Prepare Sample Data

First, let's prepare a simulated dataset that contains `age`, `gender`, and `initial weights`.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(survey)

# Example sample dataset
sample_data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:10,
  age = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90),  # Matching age groups in the population data
  gender = c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female"),
  weights = rep(1, 10)  # Initial weights
)

# Create a survey design object with initial weights
survey_design <- svydesign(ids = ~1, weights = ~weights, data = sample_data)
```

Step 2: Define Population Margins
Next, we define the population margins for age and gender based on the population data for Segovia. Here are some example distributions for age and gender:

{r}
Copy code
# Age distribution from the population data (only using a few groups for this example)
age_distribution <- data.frame(
  age = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90),
  Freq = c(0.006791, 0.006515, 0.007027, 0.006673, 0.007834, 0.004, 0.005, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001)  # Example proportions
)

# Gender distribution from the population data
gender_distribution <- data.frame(
  gender = c("Male", "Female"),
  Freq = c(0.4670, 0.5330)  # Proportions of males and females
)
Step 3: Apply Raking
Now, we use the rake() function from the survey package to adjust the weights in our sample to reflect the population margins.

{r}
Copy code
# Raking the weights to match both age and gender distributions
raked_design <- rake(
  design = survey_design,
  sample.margins = list(~age, ~gender),
  population.margins = list(age_distribution, gender_distribution)
)

# Check the new raked weights
raked_weights <- weights(raked_design)
raked_weights
Step 4: Analysis with Raked Weights
Once the weights are adjusted, we can proceed with the analysis. For instance, here we calculate the weighted mean of age in our sample:

{r}
Copy code
# Example: Calculate the weighted mean of age after raking
weighted_mean_age <- svymean(~age, raked_design)
weighted_mean_age
Conclusion
By raking the sample weights, we can ensure that our sample better reflects the population structure of Segovia. This is particularly useful when making inferences from survey data to a larger population.

### Key Changes:
1. Added YAML header for metadata (title and output format).
2. Wrapped code chunks with Rmd code delimiters (` ```{r} ... ``` `) so that they will be executed when you render the document.
3. Structured the text into meaningful sections to make the document easy to read when rendered.

You can save this content into a `.Rmd` file and render it into an HTML, PDF, or Word document. Let me
