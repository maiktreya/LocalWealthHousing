# Updated R Script for City Case-Study Research with Adjusted Weights
# This script adjusts sample weights to be representative of both population size and average income for a specific city.

# Required Libraries
library(data.table)
library(survey)

# Load the sample dataset (replace 'vat_data.csv' with your actual file path)
# The dataset is assumed to have columns for 'city', 'weights', 'income', and other variables of interest.
vat_data <- fread('vat_data.csv')

# Step 1: Filter the data for the specific city (e.g., 'CityX').
# Replace 'CityX' with the actual city name.
city_data <- vat_data[city == 'CityX']

# Step 2: Obtain auxiliary data for the target city.
# Replace 'city_population' and 'city_income' with the actual data for the city.
city_population <- 100000  # Example: Replace with actual population data
city_income <- 30000  # Example: Replace with actual average income for the city

# Step 3: Adjust the weights for the city based on population.
# Calculate the current sum of sample weights for the city.
current_weights_sum <- city_data[, sum(weights)]

# Calculate the adjustment factor based on the population of the city.
population_adjustment_factor <- city_population / current_weights_sum

# Apply the population adjustment factor to the sample weights.
city_data[, adjusted_weights := weights * population_adjustment_factor]

# Step 4: Adjust the weights for the city based on average income.
# Calculate the current weighted average income in the city using the original weights.
current_weighted_income <- city_data[, weighted.mean(income_variable, weights)]  # Replace 'income_variable' with actual income column name

# Calculate the adjustment factor based on the average income of the city.
income_adjustment_factor <- city_income / current_weighted_income

# Apply the income adjustment factor to the adjusted weights.
city_data[, adjusted_weights := adjusted_weights * income_adjustment_factor]

# Step 5: Keep the weights for other cities unchanged.
# Merge the adjusted weights back into the full dataset.
vat_data[city == 'CityX', adjusted_weights := city_data$adjusted_weights]
vat_data[city != 'CityX', adjusted_weights := weights]  # Keep original weights for other cities

# Step 6: Validate the adjustment.
# Check that the adjusted weights sum to the population for the city.
total_adjusted_weights <- city_data[, sum(adjusted_weights)]
print(paste('Adjusted total weights for CityX:', total_adjusted_weights))
print(paste('CityX population:', city_population))

# Check that the adjusted weighted income matches the city's average income.
adjusted_weighted_income <- city_data[, weighted.mean(income_variable, adjusted_weights)]  # Replace 'income_variable' with actual income column name
print(paste('Adjusted weighted average income for CityX:', adjusted_weighted_income))
print(paste('CityX average income:', city_income))

# Step 7: Analyze the data for the city.
# Define a survey design object using the adjusted weights for the city.
svy_design_city <- svydesign(ids = ~1, weights = ~adjusted_weights, data = city_data)

# Example: Perform a weighted regression analysis.
# Replace 'outcome_variable' and 'independent_variable' with your actual variable names.
weighted_model_city <- svyglm(outcome_variable ~ independent_variable, design = svy_design_city)

# Show the summary of the regression results.
summary(weighted_model_city)

# Step 8: Replication
# This methodology can be replicated for any other city by filtering the data for
# a different city and applying the same steps for weight adjustment and analysis.
# Ensure that population and income data are updated accordingly.
